Air Quality

The project aims at building an air quality measurement station. The steps are mostly based on the [blog post](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/monitor-air-quality-with-a-raspberry-pi/), but shall be extended/modified in two respects:

* Explain the initial setup of a headless raspian on a new Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Store the information in Google Cloud

As a result a moderate technically interested person should be able to replicate the steps under supervision when having all hardware available.
